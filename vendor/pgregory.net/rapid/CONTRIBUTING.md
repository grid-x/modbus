# Issues

Any issues reported are greatly appreciated. Please consider opening an issue
not only in case you have encountered a bug, but if *anything* (be it API,
functionality, workflow, docs, ...) looks like it can be improved.

# Pull requests

Please avoid "improve the code style" kind of pull requests; in particular
`if block ends with a return statement, so drop this else and outdent its block`
suggestion of `golint` should be ignored.

If you intend to work on anything non-trivial, please open an issue first,
to discuss the design and implementation before writing any code.
